h1. Joogatunnit.info

This project parses yoga class schedules of Finnish yoga studios and makes them available 
"here":http://joogatunnit.net.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com. The purpose of this project is to try out
* modern JavaScript MVC tools (Ember.js and Handlebars.js)
* hash-based navigation on a single-page application
** thanks to cowboy's "jquery-hashchange":https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-hashchange plugin

The resulting application might even turn out to be helpful to Finnish yogis.

h2. Running the application

Before running the application, generate the JSON file by invoking @rake json_all_schools@. This
parses the yoga class descriptions from the schools' web pages. After this start Jekyll with @jekyll
--server@ in the 'jekyll' directory. This launches "Jekyll, the static site generator":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll. Now the application is available at
"http://localhost:4000":http://localhost:4000.

h2. Running tests

You can run the "Cucumber":http://cukes.info/ acceptance tests by invoking @cucumber features/*.feature@ in the
project root.
