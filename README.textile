h1. Joogatunnit.info

This project parses yoga class schedules of Finnish yoga studios and makes them available
"here":http://joogatunnit.net.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com. The purpose of this project is to try out
* modern JavaScript MVC tools (Ember.js and Handlebars.js)
* hash-based navigation on a single-page application
** thanks to cowboy's "jquery-hashchange":https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-hashchange plugin

The resulting application might even turn out to be helpful to Finnish yogis.

h2. Running tests

You can run the "Cucumber":http://cukes.info/ by invoking @cucumber features/*.feature@ in the
project root.
